## Summary
In this report, we show the environmental injustice resulted from historical racism, in particular the Redlining in US cities, that are indicated today. We got inspiration from an article by Christopher Schell and collegue ['The ecological and evolutionary consequences of systemic racism in urban environments'], which shows the profound, latent ecological impacts of systematic racism and classism. We used data to recreate some maps to evaluate the main conclusions highlighted in this article. In specific, we show how NDVI differ across blocks of each "suitability rank"ï¼Œwith the best-rated city blocks having significantly higher NDVI, showing environmental superiority. What we found corresponds to the conclusions of Schell's article.
