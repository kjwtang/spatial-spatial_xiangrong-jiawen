# Background

In August 2020, [Christopher Schell](http://directory.tacoma.uw.edu/employee/cjschell) and collegues published a review in *Science* on ['The ecological and evolutionary consequences of systemic racism in urban environments'](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/08/12/science.aay4497) , showing how systematic racism and classism has significant impacts on ecological and evolutionary processes within urban environments. Here we explore a subset of the data used to support these findings in this review and the broader literature.

The [press release](https://www.washington.edu/news/2020/08/13/systemic-racism-has-consequences-for-all-life-in-cities/) on the paper is worth a read:

> "Racism is destroying our planet, and how we treat each other is essentially structural violence against our natural world," said lead author Christopher Schell, an assistant professor of urban ecology at the University of Washington Tacoma. "Rather than just changing the conversation about how we treat each other, this paper will hopefully change the conversation about how we treat the natural world."

In the paper, Schell writes:

> "In multiple cases, neighborhood racial composition can be a stronger predictor of urban socio-ecological patterns than wealth."

**Figure 2** in the Schell paper shows how NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) tracks historical redlining. ![Fig. 1.](figures/fig2.png)

In this report, we explored one metric for how structural racism and classism underpin landscape heterogeneity in cities. We recreated the city map of San Francisco, and plot the distributions and mean vegetation patterns to explore the structural inequality and racism that Schell et al highlight in their paper. We used the following spatial data to do this:

# **1.Mapping Inequality:**

\
The introduction to the dataset we used is [here](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=3/41.245/-105.469&text=intro). The "holc_grade" column represents the assigned grades to residential neighborhoods that reflected their "mortgage security" from minimal risk to being hazardous. We will then visualize these grades on color-coded maps.

In this case, we will use San Francisco as an example to visualize the environmental injustice caused by historical Redlining. We will then be using Fresno for comparison. The grade is not randomly distributed within blocks. For instance, almost all regions with low grade (C or D) locate in current near-shore area, indicating they were poor or color residence area before.Western San Francisco has significanrlt better environmental condition and consists of mostly best-ranked blocks (A and B). This map clearly shows the spatial inequality of historical Redlining.

```{r}
sfzip <-"https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/static/downloads/shapefiles/CASanFrancisco1937.zip"

sfurl <- paste0("/vsizip/vsicurl/",sfzip)
sf <- read_sf(sfurl)
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(sf)+tm_polygons("holc_grade")
```

# **2.Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)**

NDVI is used as proxy measure of vegetation health, cover and phenology (life cycle stage) over large areas. It is calculated using multiple bands (NIR - R) / (NIR + R) from satellite images.

Now we know the area that we are interested in based on the holc_grade graph, we will start finding the NDVI, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index in the near summer. NDVI stands for the "greenness" of the land, with higher value indicates higher reflection in green wavelength, suggesting more vegetation. Dr. Jim Tucker wants us using "photosynthesis capacity" to describe NDVI, as it reflects more the ability of the land to absorb wavelength. In previous studies, there is a strong correlation of NDVI with wealth, since green space is a luxury product in most place of America.

                        property_filter = \(x) {x[["eo:cloud_cover"]] < 20})
cube <- cube_view(srs = "EPSG:4326",  
                  extent = list(t0 = start_date, t1 = "2022-08-31",
                                left = box[1], right = box[3],
                                top = box[4], bottom = box[2]),
                  nx = 1000, ny = 1000, dt = "P1M",
                  aggregation = "median", resampling = "average")
S2.mask <- image_mask("SCL", values=c(3,8,9)) # mask clouds and cloud shadows
raster_cube(col, cube, mask = S2.mask) |>
  select_bands(c("B04", "B03", "B02")) |>
  plot(rgb = 1:3)
```

As we selected the location (San Francisco), the time (summer 2022), the data source (ESA Sentinel-2), and the means to remove the cloud cover, we will carry out the calculation of NDVI. NDVI is calculated as a ratio between the red (R) and near infrared (NIR) values in traditional fashion: (NIR - R) / (NIR + R). In this case, they are represented by specific band (like B08, B04). We calculate a raster format ndvi and the average ndvi per holc_grade.

```{r}
ndvi <- 
  raster_cube(col, cube, mask = S2.mask) |>
  select_bands(c("B08", "B04")) |>
  apply_pixel("(B08-B04)/(B08+B04)", "NDVI") |>
  aggregate_time("P3M")
ave_ndvi <- ndvi |> extract_geom(sf, FUN = mean )
ndvi2 <- ndvi |>st_as_stars()
ave_ndvi
ndvi2
```

> "As you explore the materials Mapping Inequality, you will quickly encounter exactly that kind of language, descriptions of the"infiltration" of what were quite often described as "subversive," "undesirable," "inharmonious," or "lower grade" populations, for they are everywhere in the HOLC archive ....These grades were a tool for redlining: making it difficult or impossible for people in certain areas to access mortgage financing and thus become homeowners. Redlining directed both public and private capital to native-born white families and away from African American and immigrant families. As homeownership was arguably the most significant means of intergenerational wealth building in the United States in the twentieth century, these redlining practices from eight decades ago had long-term effects in creating wealth inequalities that we still see today. Mapping Inequality, we hope, will allow and encourage you to grapple with this history of government policies contributing to inequality."

## Map of current (2019) mean NDVI across city redlining from the 1950s.

At present, we already have the ndvi data, and we want to make sure that the area of the two data is the same before directly displaying the ndvi data within each tier. The following map stack our average NDVI data with holc_grade of San Francisco.

```{r}
tm_shape(ndvi2) + tm_raster(style = "quantile") + tm_shape(sf) + tm_polygons("holc_grade", alpha = 0.5) + tm_layout(legend.outside=TRUE)
```

# 3. NDVI

Now that we have average NDVI data, we joined it with the sf dataset, so that we can plot the NDVI of specific sub districts in San Francisco.From this graph,it's obvious that there are significant differences in NDVI across all grades, and better grades like A and B are associated with higher NDVI.This provides evidence for the environmental inequality caused by historical injustic, making vulnerable communities even more harsh and perilous.

```{r}
ave_ndvi |> as_tibble()
sf2 <- sf |> rowid_to_column("FID")
ndvi_poly <- left_join(sf2 , ave_ndvi)
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_basemap() + 
tm_shape(ndvi_poly) + tm_polygons("NDVI", palette = "Greens") + 
  tm_shape(ndvi_poly) + tm_text("holc_grade", size = 0.5) + 
  tm_layout(legend.outside=TRUE)
```

## NDVI Average in each Grade of Land:

Now that we know the mean between each grade, can we verify it with the overall mean? We can calculate this by taking some simple averages.Here we summarize the mean NDVI across every holc_grade. The NDVI for the 2 worst grades (C and D) are almost the same, while the blocks with the a little better grade (B) has slightly greater NDVI. As Redlining's zoning is dominated by D, it cannot be proved that Redlining has a direct relationship with lower NDVI based on a single case in San Francisco.However, blocks with the best grade (A) has significanrly higher NDVI than all others (almost 150% of grade B).

```{r}
ndvi_poly |> as_tibble() |>
  group_by(holc_grade) |>
  summarise(mean_NDVI = mean(NDVI))
```


## Fresno as Comparison

We will compare Fresno, an inland city, to San Francisco to increase scientific significance. Fresno's process resembles those for SF, and we will merge everything directly, and present the result & final mean as a map.

              bbox = c(box),
              datetime = paste(start_date, end_date, sep="/"),
              limit = 100) |>

  stac_image_collection(items$features,
                        asset_names = c("B02", "B03", "B04","B08", "SCL"),
                        property_filter = \(x) {x[["eo:cloud_cover"]] < 20})
fs_cube <- cube_view(srs = "EPSG:4326",  
                  extent = list(t0 = start_date, t1 = "2022-08-31",
                                left = box[1], right = box[3],
                                top = box[4], bottom = box[2]),
                  nx = 1000, ny = 1000, dt = "P1M",
                  aggregation = "median", resampling = "average")
S2.mask <- image_mask("SCL", values=c(3,8,9))

  raster_cube(col, fs_cube, mask = S2.mask) |>

  apply_pixel("(B08-B04)/(B08+B04)", "NDVI") |>
  aggregate_time("P3M")
fs_ave_ndvi <- fs_ndvi |> extract_geom(fs, FUN = mean)
ndvi3 <- fs_ndvi |>st_as_stars()
tm_shape(ndvi3) + tm_raster(style = "quantile") + tm_shape(fs) + tm_polygons("holc_grade", alpha = 0.5)+ tm_layout(legend.outside=TRUE)
fs_ave_ndvi |> as_tibble()
fs2 <- fs |> rowid_to_column("FID")
ndvi_poly2 <- left_join(fs2 , fs_ave_ndvi)
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_basemap() + 
tm_shape(ndvi_poly2) + tm_polygons("NDVI", palette = "Greens") + 
  tm_shape(ndvi_poly2) + tm_text("holc_grade", size = 0.5)+ 
  tm_layout(legend.outside=TRUE)
ndvi_poly2 |> as_tibble() |>
  group_by(holc_grade) |>
  summarise(mean_NDVI = mean(NDVI))
```

Fresno is a famous agricultural city, and during the planting period, we can expect a high NDVI (any plant has a high NDVI, and in the city area and density are more important than the type of plant). When the overall Sample value was large, we found that the NDVI value of area D, where Redlining was located, was significantly lower. These two very different cities collectively suggest that NDVI provides evidence of social injustic impact of historical racism practices like Redlining.

# Exercise 3:

**Explain why considering systematic inequity and racism is important in the context of global change and developing solutions to the biodiversity crisis.**

Considering the systematic inequality helps inform a more comprehensive understanding on the historical background of many environmental crisis today. For instance, despite climate change being a global environmental issue, systematic injustices and inequality has resulted in uneven harm against certain groups of people who are usually the least responsible for such crisis, and have minor financial or social influence. When developing solutions of biodiversity crisis, it's important to identify the most vulnerable regions/people that should be prioritized. Moreover, future solution including regeneration and sustainability should aim for redress the issues caused by historical inequality. As professor Schell pointed out, incorporating environmental justice principles into our interpretation of urban ecology and biodiversity is vital, as they laid the foundation of effective conservation and sustainability. This also helps to foster civic responsibility and enhance social resiliency.
